# World_Weather_Analysis

## This analysis includes three deliverables:

  1) Python code that performs an API call to download weather data for 2000 random locations worldwide, further downselecting 697 locations which are matched to the nearest city, creating a weather database (in .csv format) including data fields for city, country, latitude, longitude, maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and current weather.
  2) Python code that uses the database from #1 above to downselect desirable tourist destinations, (those with maximum temperatures between 75 and 90 degrees). These resulted in a vacation map with 250 locations, displaying city, country, current weather, maximum temperature, and the name of a nearby hotel.
  3) Python code that generates selects four cities in the northeastern US as travel destinations, generating maps that display a travel circuit connecting all four cities, along with the same popup information created in step #2 above.
